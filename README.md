# Data_visualisation

# Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## *Prepare the Data
Run the provided package dependency and data imports, and then merge the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

## *Create bar charts and pie charts

1-Display the number of unique mice IDs in the data,

and then check for any mouse ID with duplicate time points.

Display the data associated with that mouse ID,
and then create a new DataFrame where this data is removed. 
![image](https://github.com/fahr-khadija/data_visualisation/blob/main/clean%20data.png)

Use this cleaned DataFrame for the remaining steps.
## *Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
Display the updated number of unique mice IDs.

# Checking the number of mice in the clean DataFrame.
num_unique_mice = clean_data['Mouse ID'].nunique()
print("Number of unique mice:", num_unique_mice)

## *Create a line plot and a scatter plot

## *Generate summary statistics
Generate Summary Statistics
Create a DataFrame of summary statistics. Remember, there is more than one method to produce the results you're after, so the method you use is less important than the result.

## *Calculate correlation and regression
Your summary statistics should include:
